Agent System for KMMLU Evaluation
===================================

This repository contains code to build an agent system for evaluating performance on the KMMLU benchmark (Criminal-Law category) using GPT-4o-mini and text-embedding-small models.

Overview:
---------
This pipeline:
1. Loads raw KMMLU data (both training and test splits) from the Hugging Face Hub.
2. Cleans the raw data.
3. Builds a retrieval index from the training data (using only question text and options, with no answer leakage) via the text-embedding-small model.
4. For each test question, retrieves similar examples from the training set.
5. Constructs a prompt that includes retrieval context plus the test question.
6. Calls the OpenAI batch API (using GPT-4o-mini) to obtain answers in structured JSON.
7. Evaluates the modelâ€™s accuracy against the ground truth.
8. Saves the batch API input and output JSONL files and benchmark score.

Setup Instructions:
-------------------
Requirements:
    - Python 3.9+
    - Poetry (for dependency management)
    - Docker and docker-compose

Using Poetry:
    1. Install Poetry if not already installed: https://python-poetry.org/docs/
    2. Run: `poetry install`
    3. Then execute: `poetry run python main.py`

Using Docker:
    1. Build and run the container using docker-compose:
         docker-compose up --build
    2. Make sure to set your OPENAI_API_KEY in the environment.
